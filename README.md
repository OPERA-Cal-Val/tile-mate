This tool provides a tool to create continuous rasters of global publicly available tiles such as Pekel Occurence and ESA 10 m land cover. This is a simpler cousin of [`dem-stitcher`](https://github.com/ACCESS-Cloud-Based-InSAR/dem-stitcher) without the need for basic post-processing (e.g. fractional pixel translation and vertical datum transformations).


The API can be summarized as
```
from tile_mate import get_raster_from_tiles

bounds = [-120.55, 34.85, -120.25, 35.15]
X, p = get_raster_from_tiles(bounds, tile_shortname='esa_world_cover_2021')

# X is an c x m x n numpy array, where c is the number of channels specified by `count`
# p is a dictionary (or a rasterio profile) including relevant GIS metadata; CRS is epsg:4326
```

The rasters are returned in the global lat/lon projection `epsg:4326` and the API assumes that bounds are supplied in this format.

```
import rasterio

with rasterio.open('esa_worlf_cover_2021_subset.tif', 'w', **p) as ds:
   ds.write(X)
```

# Installation

In order to easily manage dependencies, we recommend using dedicated project environments
via [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
or [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

1. Install the environment in this repository with `mamba env update -f environment.yml`
2. Activate the environment `conda activate tile-mate`
3. Install the library with `pip` via `pip install tile-mate`

For development, clone the repository and navigate to it in the terminal.

```
python -m pip install . -e
```

Python 3.10+ is supported.

# Notebooks

We have notebooks to demonstrate common usage:
